# Vigenere-Java-
This is a vigenere cipher program written by me, Jason Tannickal. 
The program requests some message and a key, which will then encrypt the message via a vigenere cipher function.
The program will also ask for the key again from the user for decryption.
I know there are shorter programs for this cipher but I guess I had a lot of fun going overboard with certain data structures.
